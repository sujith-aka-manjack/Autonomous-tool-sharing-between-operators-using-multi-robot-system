* -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* | Sender | Sender | Sender  | Leader |   Team    | Hop count | Connection |  Shared   |   Teams   |   Relay   |      Connections      |  End  |
* | State  |   ID   | Team ID | Signal |  Switch   |           |  Message   |  Message  |   Nearby  |  Message  | (2 bytes for ID x 30) | (255) |
* 
* 
* - (4) Leader Signal
*   - Leader    : task signal [1]
* 
* - (5)-(7) Team Switch Signal
*   - Leader informs a follower to join another team
*       - robotID [2]
*       - teamID [1]
* 
* - (8)-(16) Hop count
*   Prefix with number of messages (max 2) [1]  //2 types of hop count
*   - HopMsg [4] (teamID [1], count [1], ID [2])
* 
* - (17)-(29) Connection Message
*   Prefix with number of messages (max 2) [1]
*   - ConnectionMsg [6]
* 
*       - Exchanging ConnectionMsg within a team:
*           - If message destination is to leader, relay upstream
*           - If message sender is the leader, relay downstream
*
*       - Exchanging ConnectionMsg between follower and connector:
*           - Follower will send up to one request message (R)
*           - Connector will send up to two approval messages (A) (since a new connector can join from all the teams, 2 in this case)
* 
* - (30)-(34) Shared Message
* 
*       - Share information about the closest connector to the team
*           - shareToLeader: Upstream (Follower to Leader)
*           - shareToTeam  : Downstream (Leader to Follower)
*       - Share information about the shortest distance to the other team (only when no connector is detected)
*           - shareDist    : Upstream (Follower to Leader) 
* 
* - (35)-(37) Teams Nearby
*   Prefix with number of teams nearby (max 2) [1]
*   - teamID [1]
* 
*       - Used by connectors to determine whether other connectors can switch to a follower
* 
* - (38)-(58) Relay Message
*   Prefix with number of messages (max 2) [1]
*   - RelayMsg [10] (Type [1], Leader ID [2], time sent [2], first follower [2], follower_num [1], task_min_num [1]. robot_num [1])
* 
*       - Message sent by a leader to other leaders
